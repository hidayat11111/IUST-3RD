A Recursive function is a function which calls itself, and after every iteration it moves towards the solution of the problem.

Whether recursive function has finished its job or not is defined by the stopping condition. (If conditional statement , as you asked in question.)

Stopping condition can be any conditional statement (most cases), or it can be exception depending upon the implementation.

Any recursive function without stoppage condition goes to infinite loop and blow up the stack.
