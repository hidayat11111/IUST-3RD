 
Loops are more efficient and fast to operate. Recursion is not faster than loops, because loops have built-in support in CPUs, whereas recursion is implemented using the generally slower function call / return mechanism. The reason for iteration being generally more efficient is that in general the cost of a loop construct is lower than a function call while as recursion requires storing/loading several registers, including the program counter and in some cases doing some routine work like setting up a context for exception processing. That all leads to more CPU-cycles and to more stack usage than a simple loop would take.
